# Restaurant Landing Page

Welcome to the Restaurant Landing Page project! This project is built using React.js, Material-UI (mui/material), and React Icons to create a modern and visually appealing landing page for a restaurant. Whether you are a developer looking to explore React or someone interested in creating a restaurant website, this project serves as a great starting point.

## Features

- **React.js:** The project is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient and modular development.

- **Material-UI:** We have used Material-UI, a React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design principles. This provides a consistent and responsive design for the restaurant landing page.

- **React Icons:** The project uses React Icons to easily integrate customizable icons, enhancing the visual appeal of the website.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-landing-page.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd restaurant-landing-page
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the website by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized for clarity and modularity. Here's a brief overview:

- **`src`**: Contains the source code of the React application.
  - **`components`**: Reusable React components used to build the landing page.
  - **`pages`**: React components representing different pages of the website (e.g., Home, Menu, About).
  - **`styles`**: Stylesheets and theming for the Material-UI components.
  - **`App.js`**: The main entry point for the React application.

Feel free to explore and customize the components to fit the specific needs of the restaurant.
